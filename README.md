# Beyond activated carbon properties and hydrophobicity: Data-driven assessment of organic micro-pollutant treatability and mechanistic insights. 
This repository serves as supplementary material for our manuscript "Beyond activated carbon properties: Data-driven assessment of organic micro-pollutant adsorbability and mechanistic insights."

The core codes of model comparision and training are included in ./Model.

The SHAP and PDP analysis are included in ./Interpretable analysis.
